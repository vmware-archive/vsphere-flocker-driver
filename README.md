# [VMware vSphere®](http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere) [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/flocker/introduction/) Driver

[ClusterHQ](https://clusterhq.com)'s [Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/flocker/introduction/) provides an efficient and easy way to connect persistent store with [Docker](http://docker.com) containers. This project provides a plugin to provision persistent data volumes on VMware's vSphere storage backend.

## Installation

### Pre-requisites:
  - Setup VSAN cluster on your VC. (Minimum 3 ESXi hosts)
  - Let the name of the vsan datastore be say: `vsanDatastore`
  - Create directory with name "FLOCKER" on this datastore. Flocker volumes will reside in this path.
    `[vsanDatastore]/FLOCKER`

### Install:

- Deploy Ubuntu VMs (which you will use as Flocker nodes) on VSAN cluster.
  - Power off these VMs and enable disk uuid on these VMs by adding following to the vmx files.
   ```bash
   disk.EnableUUID​ = "TRUE"
   ```
  - Power on these VMs and install VMware Tools, scsitools and sg3-utils
    - Ubuntu<br>
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install -y open-vm-tools scsitools sg3-utils
     ```
  - One of these VMs should have Flocker control service installed.
    - Follow the Ubuntu specific steps on [this guide](https://docs.clusterhq.com/en/1.0.3/using/installing/index.html​) for installing Flocker.


- Steps to install `vsphere-flocker-driver`:
  ```bash
  /opt/flocker/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/vmware/vsphere-flocker-driver.git
  ```

## Usage Instructions
To start the plugin on a node, a configuration file must exist on the node at `/etc/flocker/agent.yml`. This should be as follows:
```yaml
version: 1
control-service:
hostname: "{IP/Hostname of Flocker-Control Service}"
dataset:
backend: "vsphere_flocker_plugin"
vc_ip: "{VC_IP}"
username: "{VC_Username}"
password: "{VC_Password}"
datacenter_name: "Datacenter"           # VC datacenter name
datastore_name: "vsanDatastore"         # VC VSAN datastore name as above
```

Please see configuration examples in the [config directory](vsphere_flocker_plugin/config/).
